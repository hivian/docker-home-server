# Docker Home Server

A robust and extensible self-hosted homeserver setup.

Even though being only used on your local network it uses ```https``` via a wildcard certificate for every service. You can still access from all around the world via a VPN e.g. Wireguard. Traefik is the reverse proxy for all the services.

## Prerequisites

- Server running docker
- Domain (e.g [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/))
- DNS A-record pointing to your main server ip (e.g. 192.168.1.2)
- Wildcard CNAME record for your services, pointing to your A-record domain
- Docker compose files make use of environment variables. ```mv .env.template .env``` in root folder and subfolders, then update variables accordingly

## Initial Setup

Run 
```
docker network create traefik-network
./docker-compose.sh ACTIVE_SERVICES up -d
```

## Dashboard

The default dashboard is [homepage from benphelps](https://github.com/benphelps/homepage) (```./homepage```). Most services are already configured to appear on the dashboard when they are up and running.
